All of the photos that pyro posted are of sharks 
that pose a danger, but there are far less shark 
attacks per year that kill people than there are 
people who died playing pokemon go and walking into traffic.
That, to me, is wild. We have not fact checked
this point; however, we are confident that sharks
are beautiful, majestic and worthy of riding into battle.
